	abstract={Synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons passing through an undulator placed in a storage ring is decomposed in coherent modes. The case of ultimate storage rings where the electron emittance is comparable to the emittance of the photon fan is analyzed by means of the cross spectral density and the coherent mode spectrum. The proposed method permits naturally the statistical analysis and propagation of the cross spectral density along the beamline optics. The coherence properties of the X-ray beam at any point of the beamline are completely given in terms of the eigenvalues and coherent modes of the cross spectral density.}

An important step has been made in restructuring the code following new computer engineering standards, ending with a modular Fortran 2003 structure and an application programming interface (API). The new code has been designed to be compatible with the original file-oriented {\it SHADOW} philosophy, but simplifying the compilation, installation and use. In addition, users can now become programmers using the newly designed {\it SHADOW3} API for creating scripts, macros and programs; being able to deal with optical system optimization, image simulation, and also low transmission calculations requiring a large number of rays (>10${\sp 6}$). Plans for future development and questions on how to accomplish them are also discussed.},

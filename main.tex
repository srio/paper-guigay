\begin{abstract}
The location of the beam focus produced when monochromatic x-ray radiation is diffracted by a bent crystals is predicted by the crystal lens equation. We derived this equation on the basis of geometrical concepts. This equation has little utility for diffraction in Laue geometry. The formation of focii for the Laue symmetrical case is discussed using concepts of dynamical theory and an extension of the lens equation is proposed. The existence of additional polychromatic focus is analyzed and the feasibility of matching focal positions by polychromatic and monochromatic focusing is discussed.

\section{Introduction}

The use of curved crystals to diffract and focus x-rays was a natural extension of the principles used in mirror and grating technology for radiation of longer wavelength. Some fundamental concepts exported to crystal optics, like the Rowland circle, date back to the XIX century \cite{rowland1882}.

The fundamental mounting types using bent crystals focusing were proposed in the early 1930â€™s. Systems exploiting meridional focusing are: i) Johann spectrometer \cite{Johann1931}, that uses a cylindrically bent crystal,  ii) Johansson spectrometer \cite{Johansson1933} that uses a ground and cylindrically bent crystal, iii) the Cauchois spectrometer \cite{cauchois1933} exploiting a Laue crystal. The von Hamos spectrometer \cite{V.Hamos1933} apply sagittal focusing in the plane perpendicular to the diffraction plane.

With the advent of synchrotron radiation, the concepts of geometrical focusing were applied to design instruments such as polychromators for energy-dispersive extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) \cite{Tolentino:ms0206}, monochromators with sagittal focusing for bending magnet beamlines \cite{Sparks1980}, or several types of crystal analyzers adopted, in particular, at inelastic x-ray scattering beamlines. Bent crystals in transmission or Laue geometry are often employed in beamlines operating at high photon energies. The crystal curvature is used for focusing or collimating the beam in the meridional \cite{Suortti1988} or sagittal \cite{Zhong2001} planes, or just to enlarge the energy bandwidth and improve the luminosity. The concepts of crystal bandwidth and aberrations came into play to better profit of the good characteristics of synchrotron beams, particularly the good collimation and small source size. For beamline monochromators  most systems work under off-Rowland conditions, whereas crystal analysers for applications such as inelastic scattering studies apply the Rowland setting.

The geometrical theory of image formation for mirrors working in grazing incidence gives a first idea of the image formed by reflection of meridional rays at a spherical reflector \cite{KB1948}. The Gaussian mirror equation (mirror or lens equation), relates the object distance $p$ and the image distance $q$ to the focal length $f$, $p^{-1}+q^{-1}=f^{-1}$, with $f=R \sin\theta$, where $R$ is the mirror curvature radius and $\theta$ the grazing incidence angle. However, this mirror or lens equation has limited applications when using crystals, as it can be applied only for symmetric Bragg reflections.

The conservation of the tangential component of the wavevector on the crystal surface leads to more general equations in Bragg or Laue geometries, resembling the focusing equations for reflection or transmission gratings.
A ``Crystal lens equation" (CLE) was indeed formulated by \cite{CK} for the focusing properties of a cylindrically bent crystal plate in Bragg diffraction of monochromatic x-rays or neutrons, in Laue (transmission) or Bragg (reflection) geometry, the crystal being bent around an axis perpendicular to the diffraction plane (meridional focusing). This CLE is based on a purely geometric approach in which the multiple scattering processes in the crystal (dynamical effects) are not taken into account. 
The derivation of the CLE is presented in Section~\ref{sec:CLE}, which also corrects
some errors found in \cite{CK} for the Laue geometry.

The CLE has wide applicability in Bragg geometry \cite{Caciuffo1987}. However, the usability of the CLE is much restricted in the case of Laue geometry, because it is only applicable to a crystal plate of vanishing thickness, thus negligible reflectivity. Moreover, it does not give account of a dynamical focusing effects first  predicted in the case of flat crystals by \cite{AfanasevKohn1977} and confirmed experimentally by references \cite{Aristov1978} and \cite{Aristov1980}. The focusing of x-ray beams by Laue crystals as predicted by the dynamical diffraction is  thoroughly described in section~\ref{sec:dynamlicalLaue}. Here, after introducing basic results from the Takagi-Taupin equation in section~\ref{sec:influence}, we give a simple and general description of the focusing effect in the case of a flat crystal plate of finite thickness (section \ref{sec:LaueFlat}). Then, we deduce in section~\ref{sec:LaueNewCLE} an improved form of the CLE for a Laue bent crystal (presently, only in the case of symmetric reflection). We verified its convergence to the CLE in the limit of vanishing crystal thickness (section~\ref{sec:LaueCompatibilityCLE}). 

The application of the lens equation in symmetrical Bragg geometry is discussed in section~\ref{sec:BraggGeometry}. %with comparison to recent numerical simulations \cite{Honkanen2018}) which are based on a finite element method to take the propagation in the crystal into account.
The CLE is in general different from the well known conditions of polychromatic focusing. Particular cases of coincidence of these two focusing conditions are considered in section~\ref{sec:polychromatic}. A final summary of the results is given in section~\ref{sec:summary}.   


\section{The crystal lens equation revisited}
\label{sec:CLE}

A lens equation was derived by \cite{CK} for the case of a monochromatic x-ray or neutron wave diffracted by a cylindrically bent crystal plate. The equation deals with Bragg and Laue geometries with source and image in real or virtual positions (see Fig.~\ref{fig:geometries}). A similar derivation is presented here fixing some problem found for the Laue case.

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:geometries}
\caption{Representing the real or virtual source of the incident beam in the Bragg or Laue geometries:

}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth,trim=5cm 2cm 7cm 2cm,clip=true]{fig_geometries.pdf}
\end{figure}

Consider a monochromatic x-ray or neutron beam emitted by a point-source $S$. The origin of coordinates is chosen at the point $O$ of the crystal surface in such a way that the wave-vector  ${\vec k_0}$ of the \inblue{central} incident ray $\vec{SO}$, is in exact Bragg  position. The diffracted ray has a wave-vector $\vec k_h$ given by the Laue equation $\vec k_h = \vec k_0 + \vec h$, where $\vec h$ is the reciprocal lattice vector (see Fig.~\ref{fig:vectors}). This is valid for both transmission geometry (Laue) or reflection geometry (Bragg). 

We use oriented angles $\varphi_0 = (\vec n, \vec k_0)$ and $\varphi_h = (\vec n, \vec k_h)$, where $\vec n$ is the inward normal to the crystal surface. $\varphi_0$ is positive, without loss of generality; $\theta_B$ is the modulus of the Bragg angle, equal to $|\varphi_0-\varphi_h|/2$ in Laue case and  $|\varphi_h-\varphi_0|/2$ in Bragg case. The special case of symmetric geometry, with asymmetry angle $\alpha=0$ is such that $\varphi_{0,h}=\pm\theta_B$ in Laue or $\varphi_{0,h}=(\pi/2)\mp\theta_B$ in Bragg. Otherwise, the asymmetry angle $\alpha$ is defined as the angle of rotation of the vectors $(\vec h, \vec k_0, \vec k_h)$ from their directions in the symmetrical case. 
It follows that $2\alpha=(\varphi_0+\varphi_h)/2$ in Laue case and  $2\alpha+\pi=\varphi_0+\varphi_h$ in Bragg case.

When moving the point of incidence over a small distance $s$ along the curved crystal surface, $\vec{k_{0,h}}$ are changed in direction, with rotating angles $\epsilon_{0,h} = (\vec k_{0,h},\vec k'_{0,h})$, and $\varphi_{0,h}$ are changed into $\varphi'_{0,h}=\varphi_{0,h}+\Delta \varphi_{0,h}$.
The projections of  $\vec k'_{h,0}$ \inblue{on the crystal surface} are equal to $k\sin\varphi_{0,h}$. Furthermore, in the studied case of cylindrical bending \inblue{in the diffraction plane}, the projection on the crystal surface of $\vec h$ remains constant \inblue{(because the angle between $\vec h$ and $\vec n$ is unchanged along the crystal surface).
}
This implies that $(\sin \varphi_h - \sin \varphi_0)$ is invariant, therefore
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:invariant}
    \Delta \varphi_h \cos\varphi_h = \Delta \varphi_0 \cos\varphi_0.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:vectors}
\caption{Schematic view of the relevant parameters in focusing by a bent crystal. \todo{add Laue case?}
}
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth,trim=5cm 2cm 10cm 2cm,clip=true]{fig_vectors.pdf}
\end{figure}

The source distance $L_0=\bar{SO}$ is set as positive if the source is on the incidence side of the crystal (real source) or negative if the source is on the other side (virtual source) (see Fig.~\ref{fig:geometries}). The radius of curvature $R$ is set as positive if the x-ray beam is incident on the concave side of the bent crystal surface. The focus distance $L_h$ is set as positive if the real or virtual focus is situated on the incidence side on the crystal. With these conventions, $(\vec n,\vec n')=s/R$, $\epsilon_0 L_0 = s \cos\varphi_0$,  $\epsilon_h L_h = s |\cos\varphi_h|$. Using the relationship
\begin{equation}
    \varphi'_{0,h} = 
    (\var n',  \vec k'_{0,h}) = 
    (\vec n', \vec n) + (\vec n,\vec k_{0,h}) + (\vec k_{0,h}, \vec k'_{0,h}) = -\frac{s}{R} + \varphi_{0,h} + \epsilon_{0,h},
\end{equation}
we obtain

\begin{equation}
\label{angles}
\Delta \varphi_0 = s \frac{\cos\varphi_0}{L_0} - \frac{s}{R}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
\Delta \varphi_h = s \frac{|\cos\varphi_h|}{L_h} - \frac{s}{R}.
\end{equation}

The crystal lens equation is finally obtained by inserting these expressions in equation~(\ref{eq:invariant})

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CLE}
\frac{|\cos\varphi_h| \cos\varphi_0}{L_h} - \frac{\cos^2\varphi_0}{L_0} = \frac{\cos\varphi_h - \cos\varphi_0}{R}.
\end{equation}


Equation~\ref{eq:CLE} is valid in both Bragg and Laue cases. In the Laue symmetrical case ($\cos\varphi_h=\cos\varphi_0$) it correctly predicts $L_h=L_0$ \inblue{(for a real source, the focus is virtual at the same distance than the source)} and particularly that a plane incident wave produces a plane reflected wave ($L_h$ goes to infinity if $L_0$ is itself infinity).

The crystal lens equation~(\ref{eq:CLE}) obtained here is different from the equation given in \cite{CK}\footnote{ 
$
\cos\varphi_h |\cos\varphi_0|/L_h + \cos^2\varphi_0/L_0 = (\cos\varphi_0 + \cos\varphi_h)/R 
$}. Both equations are equivalent for the Bragg case ($\cos\varphi_h<0$), but not for the Laue case.

Equation~\ref{eq:CLE} is obtained here using a geometrical ray optics approach. It can also be deduced from a \inblue{wave-optics} approach as shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendixCLE}. 

\inblue{It is worth mentioning that the lens equation~(\ref{eq:CLE}) discussed here can be applied only for monochromatic radiation. Polychromatic focusing is discussed in section~\ref{sec:polychromatic} in the more general context of dynamical theory of diffraction.

Note that we used in this section the same notation as \cite{CK}. For the rest of the paper, we choose the notation:    $p \leftarrow L_0$, $q \leftarrow -L_h$ $R \leftarrow -R$ $\theta_1 \leftarrow \varphi_0$ and $\theta_2 \leftarrow \varphi_h$ }

\section{Dynamical focusing in Laue geometry}
\label{sec:dynamlicalLaue}

\inblue{The applicability of the CLE for the Laue case is very limited. The results predicted by CLE ignore dynamical effects that are fundamental to consider to have a realistic view of the beam evolution after diffraction by a Laue crystal. Effects predicted by the dynamical theory of diffraction do produce ``new" focal conditions, even for flat Laue crystals, that should be considered in real cases and are not explained by the simple CLE. We analyze here the focusing of x-rays by Laue crystals and relate the obtained results with the CLE. }

In this section, the wave propagation in a crystal of finite thickness is considered, following the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction (see book of \cite{authierbook}). Wave propagation in free space is based on paraxial wave optics.

The incident wave-amplitude is expressed in a plane perpendicular to the direction of \inred{\sout{Bragg}} incidence direction at a negligible distance from the entrance surface \inblue{(axis $\tau$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:vectors}).}
Similarly, we will express the Bragg-diffracted amplitude $D_h$ in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the Bragg diffraction at a negligeable distance from the exit surface \inblue{(axis $\xi$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:vectors}).}

\todo{Next ``outline" paragraphs duplicates in some way the one in the introduction. REMOVE OR REDUCE?}

\inred{Section~\ref{sec:influence} introduces the Takagi-Taupin equations and the influence function representing the wavefield for a point-source on the crystal entrance surface.

Section~\ref{sec:LaueFlat} deals with the dynamical focusing effect without crystal bending, first described in \cite{AfanasevKohn1977} CHECK 1977 or 1971? In the symmetric case \cite{kushnir}; \cite{GuigayFerrero2013} this effect is conveniently explained using the influence function in the more general case of asymmetric geometry (section~\ref{sec:LaueCompatibilityCLE}). 


The equations of dynamical focusing by a bent Laue crystal of arbitrary thickness used by \cite{GuigayFerrero2016} are briefly recalled in section \ref{sec:LaueNewCLE},  Its agreement with the CLE (equation~\ref{eq:CLE}) in the limit of vanishing crystal thickness is verified in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix2}.
}
\subsection{Influence function derived from the Takagi-Taupin equations}
\label{sec:influence}

The x-ray wavefield is expressed as the sum of two modulated plane waves

\begin{equation}
    \Psi(\vec x) = D_0(\vec x) e^{i \vec k_0 . \vec x} + D_h(\vec x) e^{i \vec k_h . \vec x},
\end{equation}
with slowly varying amplitudes $D_{0,h}(\vec x)$. The incident wave is also expressed as a modulated plane wave $D_{inc}(\vec x) \exp(i\vec k_k . \vec x)$. The Takagi-Taupin equations  (\cite{Takagi} \cite{Takagi1962} \cite{Taupin} \cite{Taupin1967}) hereafter referred to as TTE, are

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TT}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial D_0}{\partial s_0} =& \frac{ik}{2} \left[ \bar{\chi} D_0(\vec x)+c \chi_{\bar h} e^{i \vec h . \vec u (\vec x)} D_h(\vec x) \right]; \\
\frac{\partial D_h}{\partial s_h} =& \frac{ik}{2} \left[ \bar{\chi} D_h(\vec x)+c \chi_{h} e^{-i \vec h . \vec u (\vec x)} D_0(\vec x) \right],
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $k=2\pi/\lambda$; $\bar \chi$, $\chi_h$, and $\chi_{\bar h}$ are the Fourier coefficients of the crystal polarisability. The \inblue{polarization} factor $c$ ($c=1$ for $\sigma$-polarization and $c=\cos2\theta_B$  for $\pi$-polarization) will be omitted afterwards, for simplicity. 
In equations~(\ref{eq:TT}) $\vec u (\vec x)$ is the dispacement field of the deformed crystal. The ``influence functions", hereafter called IF, are the solutions of the TT equations corresponding to a point source in the crystal entrance surface.
\inblue{It is convenient to express the spatial position $\vec x$ in oblique coordinates $(s_0,s_h)$ along the directions of the $\vec k_0$ and $\vec k_h=\vec k_0 + \vec h$ vectors .}
In the case of a cylindrically bent crystal, the deformation phase factor is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cylinder}
    \vec h . \vec u = -A s_0 s_h + \phi_1(s_0) - \phi_2(s_h)
\end{equation}
where $A$ and the $\phi_{1,2}$ functions are defined in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix2}.
Equation~(\ref{eq:cylinder}) corresponds to the case of a ``constant strain gradient" \cite{authierbook} meaning that $\partial^2(\vec h . \vec u)/(\partial s_0 \partial s_h)$ is constant.

An incident monochromatic wave of any form, can also be expressed as a modulated plane wave $D_{inc}(\vec x)\exp(i\vec k_0. \vec x)$ defining a continuous distribution of coherent point-sources on the crystal surface, according to the general Huyghens principle in optics. The ``influence functions" (or propagators), hereafter refered to as IF, are the solutions of the TTE corresponding to these point-sources. The IF for a point-source of coordinates $(\sigma_0,\sigma_h)$, in the case of crystals with deformation that verify equation~(\ref{eq:cylinder}), are derived in \cite{GuigayFerrero2016} by formulating the TTE as integral equations and solving them by iteration, starting from the undiffracted term $D_{inc}(s_0,s_h)=\exp[ik(s_0-\sigma_0)]\delta(s_h-\sigma_h)$, \inblue{with $\delta$ the Dirac delta.} The result for $D_h$ is \cite{GuigayFerrero2016}

\begin{multline}
\label{eq:preKummer}
    D_h(s_0,s_h) = \frac{i k}{2} e^{(ik/2) \bar \chi (s'_0 + s'_h) - i\vec h.\vec u(s_o,\sigma_h)+i A s'_o s'_h } \times
    \\
    [1 + \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{(\Omega + i A )(\omega+2iA)...(\Omega+niA)}{n!n!}(-s'_0s'_h)^n],
\end{multline}
where $s'_{0,h}=s_{0,h}-\sigma_{0,h}$ and $\Omega = k^2 \chi_h \chi_{\bar h}/4$. For $A\ne0$, the equation~(\ref{eq:preKummer}) can be expressed as
% The IF of the reflected wave, in the case that equation~(\ref{eq:cylinder}) holds, and for a point source \inred{of oblique coordinates $(\sigma_0,\sigma_h)$} on the crystal entrance surface is (Petrashen, 1974; Katagawa and Kato, 1974; Litzmann and Janacek, 1974; Chukhovski and Petrashen, 1977; \cite{GuigayFerrero2016}):  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kummer}
    D_h(s_0,s_h) = \frac{i k }{2} e^{(ik/2) \bar \chi (s'_0 + s'_h) + i \vec h . \vec u (s_0,\sigma_h)} M(i\Omega/A,1,iA s'_0 s'_h)
\end{equation}
where the $M$ function is the Kummer function (a confluent hypergeometric function) defined by the series
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kummerSeries}
    M(a,b,z) = 1 + \frac{a}{b} z + 
    ... + \frac{a(a+1)...(a+n-1)}{n! b (b+1)+...(b+n-1)}z^n+...
\end{equation}

This type of solution of the TTE was already obtained a long time ago, by different methods \cite{Petrashen1974}, \cite{Katagawa1974}, \cite{Litzmann1974} and \cite{Chukhovski1977}.


In the case of $A=0$, it is seen from equation~(\ref{eq:preKummer}) that the Kummer function in equation~(\ref{eq:kummer}) reduces to the Bessel function $J_0(2\sqrt{\Omega s'_0 s'_h})$. 
          
\subsection{Dynamical focusing and Borrmann effect in a flat crystal plate in general Laue geometry}
\label{sec:LaueFlat}

\inblue{This section introduces the important case of focusing with Laue flat crystals. It will be extended in the next section to the bent crystal with a point source upstream from the crystal.}

\begin{figure}
\label{fig:laue}

\end{figure}

The dynamical focusing is most easily described by considering a point-source on the crystal entrance surface (in practice, a slit of negligible width placed near the crystal surface). 

The reflected amplitude $D_h(\xi)$, perpendicularly to the direction of $\vec k_h$ at negligible distance from the crystal of thickness $t$, is zero outside the interval $-a<\xi<a$, with $a=t \sin2\theta/(2 \cos\varphi_0)$, and it is proportional to the zeroth-order Bessel function  $J_0(Z\sqrt{a^2-\xi^2})$ in this interval (Kato, 1961), with  $Z=k\sqrt{\gamma\chi_h\chi_{\bar h}}/\sin2\theta_B$, and $\gamma=\cos\varphi_0/\cos\varphi_h$ (asymmetry ratio). In the case $|Za| \gg 1$ the asymptotic approximation
\begin{equation}
    J_0(Z\sqrt{a^2-\xi^2})\approx \left(\frac{2}{\pi Z \sqrt{a^2-\xi^2}}\right)^{1/2} \cos(Z\sqrt{a^2-\xi^2}-\pi/4)
\end{equation}
can be used in the central region $|\xi|\ll a$ where we can also use
\begin{equation}
     \sqrt{a^2-\xi^2} = a (1-\xi^2/2+...)\approx a - \frac{\xi^2}{2a}
\end{equation}

We thus obtain in this central region the approximation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:approximatedDiffractedField}
    J_0(Z\sqrt{a^2-\xi^2})\approx \left(\frac{2}{i \pi Z a}\right)^{1/2} \left( e^{iZa-i Z\frac{ \xi^2}{2a}} + i 
    e^{-i Z a+i Z\frac{\xi^2}{2a}} \right),
\end{equation}
where the two exponential terms are related to the two sheets of the dispersion surface. 
The function $\exp{\mp i Z \xi^2 / (2 a)}$ %\inblue{has the form of a spherical wave $\exp(i k \xi^2 / (2f)$, $f$=focal distance, therefore it } 
represents a converging \inblue{($\operatorname{Re}(Z)>0$)} or a diverging \inblue{($\operatorname{Re}(Z)<0$)} wavefront depending on the sign of the real part of $Z$. A double, real and virtual, focusing effect is thus expected at opposite distances $\pm q_0$ from the crystal, with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:q0}
    q_0 = \frac{k a}{|Re(Z)|}= \frac{a \sin2\theta_B}{|Re(\sqrt{\chi_h\chi_{\bar h}})|}
\end{equation}

The parameter $q_0$, which may be referred to as the ``dynamical \inblue{approximated} focal length", depends on the asymmetry angle \inblue{through} the half-width a of the Bragg-diffracted beam $a$. \inblue{It gives the position of the beam waist only approximately, as several approximations have been used}. However the reflected amplitude at any distance $q$ from the crystal can be calculated numerically, without the approximations used above, \inblue{by propagating the electric disturbance (equation XX)} via convolution with the Fresnel propagator:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Dh}
    D_h(\xi; q) = (\lambda q)^{-1/2} \int_{-a}^a d\xi'  \, e^{i k 
    \frac{(\xi-\xi')^2}{2 q}} 
    J_0(Z \sqrt{a^2-\xi'^2}).
\end{equation}
The resulting ``axial intensity profile" $|D(0,q)|^2$ shows in general two strong maxima at distances $q_{1,2}=\pm q_{dyn} < q_0$. This difference is a cylindrical aberration effect related to the approximations used to obtain equation (\ref{eq:q0}). \inblue{The parameter $q_{dyn}$ is the ``dynamical focal length" is obtained numerically, thus non-approximated (contrary to $q_0$)}. Note that $q_0$ is proportional to the crystal thickness. This is \inred{approximately true} for $q_{dyn}$. As an example, some numerical values are given in Table~\ref{table:example}.

The moduli of the two terms in equation~(\ref{eq:approximatedDiffractedField}) are in general different: they are proportional to $\exp(\mp a \operatorname{Im}(Z))$. This is the expression of anomalous absorption (Borrmann effect). Two focusing positions are to be observed in the case of small absorption; but only one focusing position is to be observed in the case of strong absorption (see Fig.~\ref{fig:flatLaue}). It turns out that this property is also valid if the crystal plate is not flat, but cylindrically bent around an axis normal to the diffraction plane. 

For the flat crystal under discussion, the focusing condition for a source at a finite distance $p$ from the crystal, is $p+q=\pm q'_{dyn}$.\inblue{
This result is simply obtained by considering that the operators to perform i)the free-space propagation from the source to the diffracting crystal, ii) effect of the crystal diffraction, and iii) the propagation downstream from the crystal to the image position are space-invariant therefore they commute since they are transformed in mutiplications in reciprocal space.} Propagation through a flat is space-invariant, whereas propagation through a bent crystal is not space-invariant. The reason for this difference is that, in a bent crystal case, the IF is not only dependent on the variables $(s'_0,s'_h)$, but also on the variables $(\sigma_0,\sigma_h)$,\inred{ as seen from formulas (10,11,16).}



\subsection{Lens equation for a bent crystal of finite thickness in symmetrical Laue geometry}
\label{sec:LaueNewCLE}

For the case of symmetrical diffraction $A=0$ in equation~(\ref{eq:cylinder}), and equation~(\ref{eq:preKummer}) becomes \cite{GuigayFerrero2013}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DhSymmetricalLaue}
    D_h(s_0,s_h) = \frac{i k}{2} \chi_h e^{\frac{i k}{2} \bar \chi (s'_0+s'_h) + i \vec h . \vec u (s_0,\sigma_h)}
    J_0(2\sqrt{\Omega s'_0 s'_h}),
\end{equation}
with $\vec h . \vec u (s_0,\sigma_h) = \phi(\sigma_h)-\phi(s_0) $, $s_0=(a+\xi)/\sin2\theta_B$, $\phi(s_0)=(k \sin\theta_B / R)(s_0 \sin2\theta_B - a)=(k \sin\theta_B / R)(\xi^2+a\xi)$.
Using the notation $R'=R \cos\theta_B$, the focal positions are given by 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{p R'}{p+R'} + \frac{q R'}{R' - q} = \pm q_{dyn},
\end{equation}
which can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:preLaueCLE}
    \frac{R'}{R'-q} + \frac{R'}{R' + p} = \pm \frac{q_{dyn}}{R'}.
\end{equation}
Translating equation~(\ref{eq:preLaueCLE}) in the notation of section~\ref{sec:CLE} ($p \to L_0$, $q \to -L_h$, $R \to -R$), we obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:newCLE}
    \frac{1}{L_h-R \cos\theta_B} -
    \frac{1}{L_0 - R \cos\theta_B} =
    \pm \frac{q_{dyn}}{(R \cos\theta_B)^2}.
\end{equation}
If $q_{dyn}$ is set to zero, we obtain $L_h=L_0$, the same result as the ``lens equation"~(\ref{eq:CLE}).
Equations~(\ref{eq:preLaueCLE}) and (\ref{eq:newCLE}) can be considered as a ``modified lens equation" which takes dynamical diffraction effects into account in symmetric Laue geometry.

\inred{We have not managed to find a closed expression like equation~(\ref{eq:newCLE}) for the general case of asymmetrical Laue diffraction. However, numerical simulations can be done to obtain the focal positions. }

We are often interested in real focusing ($q>0$) of an incident beam from a very distant real source ($p\approx \infty$), for instance, in EXAFS beamlines. $q_1$ and $q_2$ and which are both decreasing functions of $p$. Suppose $0<R'\le q_{dyn}$. When $p$ increases from zero to infinity, $q_1$ decreases from $q_1=R'q_{dyn}/(q_{dyn}+R')$ to $q_1=R'q_{dyn}/(q_{dyn}-R')$. Simultaneously, $q_2$ decreases from $q_2=R'q_{dyn}/(q_{dyn}-R')$ to $q_2=R'(q_{dyn}+R')/q_{dyn}$. For very large $p$-values, we have the simple relation $q_1+q_2\approx 2R'$.

Some numerical calculations are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:8keV}, for the case of the 111 reflection by a \SI{250}{\micro\meter} thick cylindrically bent symmetric Laue silicon crystal, with a curvature radius of $R$~= \SI{1}{\meter}, at a source distance $p$~= \SI{30}{\meter} and for x-ray photon energies of 8.3~keV and 17~keV. 
For both photon energy values, the effective value of $q_{dyn}$ is determined by plotting the axial intensity profile as function of $q$ for the unbent crystal of the same thickness and $p=0$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:flatLaue}). This allows to calculate $q_1$ and $q_2$ as
\begin{multline}
\label{eq:q1andq2}
q_1 = R' \frac{p(q_{dyn}-R')+q_{dyn}R'}{p q_{dyn}+(R'+q_{dyn})R'} \\
q_2 = R' \frac{p(q_{dyn}+R')+q_{dyn}R'}{p q_{dyn}+(q_{dyn}-R')R'}.
\end{multline}

It can be verified that the results are in perfect agreement with the values shown by the numerical plot of the axial intensity profile. \todo{show numbers...}
 
$\operatorname{Im}(Za)$ is negative in these cases. This means that the focus position with lowest absorption (therefore with largest intensity) is $q_1$. This is in agreement with the numerical plots. 
The highest peak is for $q_1<q_2$ for the x-ray energy of 17 keV. At the energy of 8 keV, only the  peak $q_1$ is present and the $q_2$ peak is damped out because the anomalous absorption effect.

\subsection{Semianalytical approach in asymmetric Laue geometry \inblue{to obtain the CLE}}
\label{sec:LaueCompatibilityCLE}

\inblue{In this section we demonstrate, for the general case of asymmetric Laue, how the CLE can be obtained from the dynamical theory in the limit of zero thickness. To obtain this result we first summarize the results of \cite{GuigayFerrero2016} that gine the expression of the diffracted field at the exit face of the crystal, which is then propagated to the image at a distance $q$. This expression has to be evaluated numerically (semi-analytically). It is shown that in the limit of zero thickness, this expression corresponds to a cylindrical wave focused in a position dictated by an expression that coincides with the CLE.}

Consider the incident  wave-amplitude $D_{inc}(\tau)=\exp(i k \tau^2/ 2 p)$ in a plane normal to the direction of Bragg incidence. In the general case of asymmetric geometry, the reflected amplitude $D_h(\xi)$ perpendicular to the direction of Bragg reflection, at negligible distance from the exit surface, is expressed by the following integration over the variable $\nu = \xi - \tau / \gamma$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:14}
    D_h(\xi) = (\lambda p)^{-1/2} \int_{-a}^{a}\gamma d\nu e^{i k \gamma^2\frac{(\xi-\nu)^2}{2 p} + 
    i \phi(\xi,\nu)} M(i\beta,1, i g k\frac{a^2-\nu^2}{R}),
\end{equation}
with
\begin{multline}
    \phi(\xi,\nu) =\frac{k}{2R}[-\mu_2\gamma^2(\xi-\nu)^2
    +a_2(\xi-\nu) \\
    -\mu_1(a+\xi)^2 
    +a_1(a+\xi) \\
    -2g(\xi+\nu)(\xi-\nu)],
\end{multline}
the parameters $\mu_{1,2}$ and $a_{1,2}$ are given in the Appendix~2, $\gamma=\cos\theta_1/\cos\theta_2$, $\theta_{1,2}=\alpha\pm\theta_B$, $a=t\sin\2\theta/(2\cos\theta_1)$, $g=-\sin\alpha \, \gamma (1+\rho)\cos^2\theta_1/(\sin^2\theta_B\cos\theta_B)$, $\beta=\gamma R k \chi_h\chi_{\bar h}/(4g\sin^22\theta_B)$, $\rho=\nu/(1-\nu)$ with $\nu$ the Poisson ratio \todo{conflict of $\nu$?}.   
The reflected amplitude at distance $q$ downstream the crystal is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:15}
    \D_h(\xi,q) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{d\xi'}{\sqrt{\lambda q}}e^{i k \frac{(\xi-\xi')^2}{2q}}D(\xi').
\end{equation}
$\psi(\xi,q)$ is therefore obtained by double integration over $\nu$ and $\xi'$. The $\xi'$-integration can be first performed analytically, after regrouping all terms depending on $\xi'$ in the integrands of equations~(\ref{eq:14}) and (\ref{eq:15}). The remaining $\nu$-integration is to be carried out numerically, as done by \cite{GuigayFerrero2016}. We consider this approach as semi-analytical, in contrast to the approach used by \cite{Nesterets} which is based on a numerical solution of the TTE.



We are now interested in the limit of the above semi-analytical formulation in the case of vanishing crystal thickness ($a\rightarrow0{}$), for comparison with the CLE. In this limit, the Kummer function is equal to unity in equation~(\ref{eq:14}), and the integral can be replaced by $2a$ times the integrand evaluated at $\nu=a=0$, therefore
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:14reduced}
    D_h(\xi) = \frac{2 a \gamma}{\sqrt{\lambda p}} e^{\frac{i k \xi^2}{2}(\frac{\gamma^2}{p}-\frac{\mu_2\gamma^2+\mu_1+2g}{R})}.
\end{equation}

This is the expression of the amplitude of a cylindrical wave focused at the distance $q$ such that
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{q}+\frac{\gamma^2}{p}+\frac{\mu_2\gamma^2+\mu_1+2g}{R}=0. 
\end{equation}
Using the identity $\mu_1+\gamma^2\mu_2+2g=(\cos\theta_2-\cos\theta_1)/\cos^2\theta_2$, which is demonstrated in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix2}, the focusing condition is 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{q}+\frac{\gamma^2}{p}+\frac{\cos\theta_1-\cos\theta_2}{R\cos^2\theta_2}=0,
\end{equation}
or,
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\cos^2\theta_2}{q}+\frac{\cos^2\theta_1}{p}+\frac{\cos\theta_1-\cos\theta_2}{R}=0,
\end{equation}
which is the CLE (equation~(\ref{eq:CLE})) for the Laue case, with the correspondence $p \rightarrow L_0$, $q \rightarrow -L_h$, $R \rightarrow -R$, $\theta_1 \rightarrow \varphi_0$ and $\theta_2 \rightarrow \varphi_h$


\section{Relevance of the lens equation in the symmetric Bragg case}
\label{sec:BraggGeometry}
Let us consider the case of a thick non-absorbing {\plane} crystal plate (without bending), in symmetrical Bragg geometry. The fact that experimental results and also numerical calculations \cite{aripekka}  of Bragg diffraction with plane crystals do not show any focusing effect \inred{(contrary to Laue case)}, can be explained by the following intuitive approach. Consider that any geometrical ray emitted from a real distant point-source produces a reflected ray at the point of incidence on the crystal surface, with a reflectivity coefficient equal to the complex reflectivity of the incident plane wave having the same glancing angle of incidence $\theta=\theta_B+\Delta\theta$ as the geometrical ray under consideration
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:braggDiffProfile}
    r(\Delta\theta) = \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\Delta\theta\sin2\theta}{|\chi_h|}\right)^2} + i \frac{\Delta\theta\sin2\theta_B}{|\chi_h|} =
    e^{i \arcsin{\frac{\Delta\theta \sin2\theta}{ |\chi_h|}}}.
\end{equation}

Note that $|r(\theta)|^2$ is the usual \inred{diffraction profile}. Taking the origin of coordinates at the point corresponding to $\theta=\theta_B$, the reflected wave-amplitude along an axis $O\xi$ situated in the diffraction plane and perpendicular to the reflected direction, at negligible distance from the crystal, may be approximated by setting  $\Delta\theta=\xi/p$ in equation~(\ref{eq:braggDiffProfile}):
\begin{equation}
    D(\xi) = e^{i \arcsin{\frac{\xi \sin2\theta}{p |\chi_h|}}}.
\end{equation}

No focusing effect is expected from this amplitude distribution, because the phase function $\arcsin(\xi \sin2\theta/ (p |\chi_h|))$, being an odd function of $\xi$, has no second-order term characteristic of a focusing effect; the first-order term produces a lateral shift of the image. There is no equivalent to the dynamical focusing length $q_{dyn}$ introduced in the Laue case. The reflected beam is indeed divergent, as in the case of a usual mirror.

The focusing properties of cylindrically bent crystals in symmetric Bragg geometry were simulated by Sutter et al. (2010), using a finite-element method, and by Honkanen et al. (2017, 2018), using a finite-element method, for numerical solution of the TTE. The obtained phase distribution of the reflected wavefront shows a parabolic shape, with concavity inversion as compared to the parabolic phase distribution of the incident wavefront. This is a clear indication of a single real focusing effect., which is indeed confirmed by simulating the reflected wave propagation. The obtained focusing distances are indeed in good agreement with the CLE which is $L_0^{-1}+L_h^{-1}=2/(R \sin\theta_B)$ in this case.

These results can be interpreted as follows: because of the deformation phase factor $\exp(-i\vec h. u(\vec x_s))$, the reflected waves acquire a quadratic phase distribution with the sign corresponding to a cylindrically convergent wave.



\section{Polychromatic focusing}
\label{sec:polychromatic}

As pointed out by \cite{CK}, the dynamical focusing effect \todo{monochromatic focusing?} is not to be confused with the polychromatic focusing effect \cite{handbook} obtained by varying the wavelength of the reflected rays in order to satisfy the exact Bragg condition on the crystal surface (the position of the point $O$ and the Bragg angle changes along the crystal surface, being the asymmetry angle constant, $\varphi_0+\varphi_h=2\alpha$ imply $\Delta\varphi_0+\Delta\varphi_h=0$). 
The polychromatic formula is \inred{which similarity to the CLE supposes a very thin crystal}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:polychromaticfocusing}
\frac{{\cos {\varphi _o}}}{{{L_o}}} + \frac{{\left| {\cos {\varphi _h}} \right|}}{{{L_h}}} = \frac{2}{R},
\end{equation}
or in the notation of section~\ref{sec:dynamlicalLaue} it becomes $-\cos\theta_0/p + |\cos\theta_h|/q=2/R$. 

It is easy to see that both monochromatic (equation (\ref{eq:CLE})) and polychromatic focusing (equation~(\ref{eq:polychromaticfocusing})) conditions coincide in the symmetric Bragg case (for which $\cos\varphi_o=-\cos\varphi_h=\sin\theta_B$), but not necessarily for the \inred{\sout{generic} symmetric} Laue case. In the symmetric Laue case, for which $\cos\varphi_o=\cos\varphi_h=\cos\theta_B$, the monochromatic condition (equation~\ref{eq:CLE}) is reduced to $L_0=L_h$ and the polychromatic condition (equation~\ref{eq:polychromaticfocusing}) is then $L_0=L_h=R\cos\theta_B$, which corresponds to Rowland geometry. Therefore the equations of monochromatic and polychromatic focusing coincide for symmetric Laue case only if the Rowland condition is satisfied.\footnote{\cite{CK} stated that they coincide if a symmetrical reflection is used {\it or} the Rowland condition is fulfilled, which is false in the symmetric Laue off-Rowland}

The equations for monochromatic focusing and polychromatic focusing do coincide if the Rowland condition $L_0=R|\cos\varphi_h|$ is satisfied, since they both give the same result $L_h=R|\cos\varphi_h|$. The bent crystal is then reflecting only a narrow energy band, because the angle of incidence on the local reflecting planes does not change along the bent crystal surface.
\inblue{In synchrotron dispersive EXAFS beamlines, the objective if to reflect a large energy bandwidth (polychromator), therefore they work off-Rowland condition. The use of symmetric Bragg reflection in most polychromators guarantees that the polychromator focuses a broad-bandwidth beam onto a small spot \cite{Tolentino:ms0206}. However, for the Laue polychromators also used in synchrotron beamlines, it is not possible to make the polychromatic CLE and monochromatic CLE coincide in off-Rowland configuration (a necessary condition to obtain a large energy bandwidth in dispersive EXAFS). But, as discussed in section~\ref{sec:dynamlicalLaue} the use if the monochromatic CLE is not adequate in Laue, but it can be replaced by a generalized CLE (equation~(\ref{eq:newCLE})) which includes postulates of the dynamical theory.  
This equation, valid for a thick crystal in symmetric Laue geometry, gives $L_h\approxR'+R'^2/q_{dyn}$ in the case of a very large source-to-crystal distance. The coincidence of polychromatic and monochromatic focusing conditions can be then realised if $L_h=R'/2=R'+R'^2/q_{dyn}$, which results in $R'=-q_{dyn}/2$ (note the beam incidence on the crystal convex side). As $R'$ is chosen by the polychromatic CLE condition, the Laue crystal can then be optimized to present also the monochromatic focusing at the same position by choosing the right $q_{dyn}$. This is possible by selecting an adequate crystal thickness \cite{Mocella2004} \cite{Mocella2008}. 
}

\section{Summary and conclusions}
\label{sec:summary}
\inblue{A crystal lens equation (CLE) based on the conservation of the parallel component of the wavevector in the diffraction process is obtained (equation~\ref{eq:CLE}). It includes all cases of symmetric and asymmetric Laue and Bragg geometries. It differs from the previous formulation \cite{CK} in the Laue case. However, the lens equation is actually of little practical interest in the Laue case, because it can be applied only if the crystal is very thin, and it neglects important effects resulting from the dynamical theory of diffraction, like the focusing of the Borrmann triangle. We derived a modified lens equation (\ref{eq:newCLE}) in the case of symmetric geometry which overcomes this restriction. Consistently, it converges in the case of zero thickness to the CLE, but with little utility in such a case. The generic case of arbitrary asymmetry is left for a future investigation.

The application of the CLE (equation~\ref{eq:CLE}) is restricted to monochromatic focusing. Polychromatic focusing, as used in the polychromators of dispersive EXAFS beamlines, happens when the wavelength of the reflected rays changes to exactly match the Bragg angle. This condition is given by a different lens equation (\ref{eq:polychromaticfocusing}). This implies a specular reflection of the rays on the Bragg planes that is, in general, incompatible with the CLE or the results of dynamical theory, except for the Bragg symmetric case, or for rays matching exactly the Bragg condition thus verifying Laue equation. Therefore, polychromatic and monochromatic focusing must be treated separately. It has been demonstrated that focii predicted by monochromatic and polychromatic focusing conditions coincide if the source is situated on the Rowland circle. Moreover, such coincidence is also true for any source position (off-Rowland) in symmetric Bragg geometry, but not in symmetric Laue geometry. Here, for the Laue symmetric case, both polychromatic and monochromatic focii can match if the modified lens equation~(\ref{eq:newCLE}) is used instead, but requires a particular choice of the crystal thickness.

% The case of symmetric Bragg geometry seems to be of particular practical interest, because of simultaneous polychromatic and monochromatic focusing. Moreover, the CLE can then be used to predict the focus position with good accuracy. Therefore, the CLE appears to be more relevant in the Bragg case rather than in the Laue case.

\section{The Crystal Lens Equation deduced from the phase-factor of the Takagi-Taupin equations}
\label{sec:appendixCLE}.

In a crystal under a deformation field $\vec u(\vec r)$, the polarizability of a crystal can be taken as $\chi(\vec r-\vec u(\vec r))$, where $\chi(\vec r)$ is the polarizability of the non-deformed crystal. The Fourier components of the electric susceptibility $\chi_h$ and $\chi_{\bar h}$ are multiplied by the phase factors $\exp(-i k \vec h . \vec u (\vec r))$ and $\exp(+i k \vec h . \vec u (\vec r))$, respectively, in the Takagi-Taupin equations which describe  the propagation inside the deformed crystal.

In the case of a very thin crystal, multiple scattering can be neglected. The incident ray at the point of coordinate x on the crystal surface is simply afected by a phase factor 
\begin{equation}
    e^{-i k \vec h . \vec u(x)} = e^{i k (\cos\varphi_h-\cos\varphi_0) \frac{x^2}{2 R} },
\end{equation}
which is easily obtained by using $\vec u(x) = -(x^2/(2R))\vec n$ and $\vec n . \vec h = \vec n.(\vec k_h - \vec k_0) = k(\cos\varphi_h-\cos\varphi_0)$. 

The incident cylindrical wave $\phi_0(\tau)=\exp[i k \tau^2 / (2L_0)]$, where $\tau$ is the coordinate along the axis $O\tau$ perpendicular to the direction $Os_0$ of Bragg incidence (see Fig.~\ref{fig:vectors}), produces the following phase distribution along the axis $Ou$ perpendicular to the direction $Os_h$ of Bragg reflection 
\begin{equation}
    D_{inc}(u) = e^{i \frac{k}{2L_0}\left(\frac{\cos\varphi_0}{\cos\varphi_h}\right)^2 u^2},
\end{equation}
where we use the geometric relations $x=\tau/cos\varphi_0=u/|\cos\varphi_h|$. The amplitude of the Bragg-reflected wave along the axis $Ou$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A4}
    D_h(\xi) = e^{i k
    \frac{\xi^2}{\cos^2\varphi_h}\left(\frac{\cos\varphi_0-\cos\varphi_h}{2R} + \frac{\cos^2\varphi_0}{2L_0}\right)},
\end{equation}
corresponding (in Laue or Bragg geometry), to a real or virtual focus if the phase of this function is negative or positive respectively. Following the notations defined in section~\ref{sec:CLE}, a real focus corresponds to $L_h<0$ in Laue case and to $L_h>0$ in Bragg case; similarly, a real \todo{virtual?} focus corresponds to $L_h>0$ in Laue case and to $L_h<0$ in Bragg \todo{Laue?} case. This means that $D(\vec u)$ can be written as $D_h(\xi) = \exp(\pm i k \xi^2 / (2L_h))$ in Laue or Bragg case, respectively. This expression can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A5}
D_u(\xi) = e^{\frac{i k \xi^2}{2 L_h}\frac{|\cos\varphi_h|}{\cos\varphi_h}}.   
\end{equation}
Comparing equations~(\ref{eq:A4}) and (\ref{eq:A5}), we finally obtain
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\cos\varphi_h-\coa\varphi_0}{R}+
    \frac{\cos^2\varphi_0}{L_0}=\frac{|\cos\phi_h|\cos\varphi_h}{L_h},
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to the lens equation (\ref{eq:CLE}).

\section{general expression of the phase factor and derivation of equation~(XX)}
\label{sec:appendix2}.


The components of the displacement field, in the case of meridional bending of radius $R$ are:
\begin{equation}
    u_x = -\frac{x(z-t/2)}{R}; \, u_z=\frac{x^2+\rho(z-t/2)^2}{2R},
\end{equation}
and $h_x=k(\sin\theta_2-\sin\theta_1)$, \inred{$h_z=k(\cos\theta_2-\cos\theta_1)$}.
In terms of the oblique coordinates $(s_0,s_h)$ along $\vec k_{0,h}$, such that $z=s_0\cos\theta_1 + s_h \cos\theta_2$ and $x=s_0 \sin\theta_1+s_h\sin\theta_2$ , 
it is found, by lengthy but simple calculations and with omission of a constant term, that $\vec h.\vec u=-A s_0 s_h + \phi_1(s_0) -\phi_2(s_h)$,  
with the following definitions
\begin{multline}
    A = -(2 k \sin\theta_B /R)\sin\alpha[1+(1+\rho)\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2] \\
    \phi_1(s_0) = \frac{k}{2R}[\mu_1(s_o\sin2\theta_B)^2-a_1 s_0\sin2\theta_B] \\
    \phi_2(s_h) = -\frac{k}{2R}[\mu_2(s_h\sin2\theta_B)^2-a_2 s_h\sin2\theta_B],
\end{multline}
where $\gamma=\cos\theta_1/\cos\theta_2$, $\theta_{1,2}=\alpha\pm \theta_B$, $a=t \sin2\theta / (2\cos\theta_1)$, 
% $\gamma=\cos\theta_1/\cos\theta_2$, $\theta_{1,2}=\alpha\pm\theta_B$, $a=t\sin\2\theta/(2\cos\theta_1)$,
$g=-\sin\alpha \, \gamma (1+\rho)\cos^2\theta_1/(\sin2\theta_B\cos\theta_B)$,
$\mu_{1,2}=[\sin\alpha(\sin^2\theta_{1,2}+\rho\cos^2\theta_{1,2})cos\alpha\sin2\theta_{1,2}]/(\sin2\theta_B\cos\theta_B)$ and
$a_{1,2}=t(\cos\alpha\sin\theta_{1,2}+\rho\sin\alpha\cos\theta_{1,2})/\cos\theta_B$ 


These formulas are simplified for a symmetric reflection ($\alpha=0$):
$A=0$, $\cos\theta_{1,2}=\cos\theta_B$, $\mu_{1,2}=\pm1/\cos\theta_B$, $a_{1,2}=\pmt\tan\theta_B$, $\phi_1$ and  $\phi_2$ have the same form $\phi(s)=k/(2R\cos\theta_B)[(s\sin2\theta_B)^2-s t \sin2\theta_B\sin\theta_B]$. 

The Poisson ratio $\rho$ is eliminated in the following expressions from section~\ref{sec:LaueNewCLE}: 
\begin{equation}
    \mu_1+g=\frac{\cos\alpha\sin2\theta_1-\sin\alpha(\gamma+\cos2\theta_1)}{\sin2\theta_B\cos\theta_B}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \gamma^2\mu_2+g=\frac{\gamma^2\cos\alpha\sin2\theta_2-\sin\alpha(\gamma+\gamma^2\cos2\theta_2)}{\sin2\theta_B\cos\theta_B}.
\end{equation}

Using
\begin{equation}
    \sin2\theta_1+\gamma^2\sin2\theta_2=2\gamma\sin\theta_1\cos\theta_2+2\gamma\sin\theta_2\cos\theta_1=2\gamma\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)=2\gamma\sin2\alpha;
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \cos2\theta_1+\gamma^2\cos2\theta_2=2\cos^2\theta_1-1+\gamma^2(\cos^2\theta_2-1)=4\cos^2\theta_1-1-\gamma^2.
\end{equation}
                   
We obtain
\begin{multline}
    \mu_1+\gamma^2\mu_2+2g=
    \frac{\cos\alpha(2\gamma\sin2\alpha)-\sin\alpha(2\gamma+4\cos^2\theta_1-1-\gamma^2)}{\cos\theta_B\sin2\theta_B} = \\
    \sin\alpha
    \frac{2\gamma(2\cos^2\alpha-1)-4\cos^2\theta_1+1+\gamma^2}{\cos\theta_B\sin2\theta_B};\\
    \cos2\alpha+\cos2\theta_B=2\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2; \\
    \cos^2\theta_1+\cos^2\theta_2=
    \frac{1+\cos(2\alpha+2\theta_B)}{2}
    +\frac{1+\cos(2\alpha-2\theta_B)}{2}=
    1+\cos2\alpha\cos2\theta_B; \\
    2\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2(\cos2\alpha-2\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2)=-(\cos2\alpha+\cos2\theta_B)\cos2\theta_B;\\
    \frac{\mu_1+\gamma^2\mu_2+2g}{\sin\alpha}=
    \frac{2\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2(\cos2\alpha-2\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2)+\cos^2\theta_2+\cos^2\theta_1}{\cos\theta_B\sin2\theta_B\cos^2\theta_2}=\\
    =\frac{\sin2\theta_B}{\cos\theta_B\cos^2\theta_2}.
\end{multline}

Therefore:
\begin{multline}
    \mu_1+\gamma^2\mu_2+2g=
    \frac{\sin\alpha\sin2\theta_B}{\cos\theta_B\cos^2\theta_2}=
    \frac{2\sin\alpha\sin\theta_B}{\cis^2\theta_B}=\\
    \frac{\cos(\alpha-\theta_B)-\cos(\alpha+\theta_B)}{\cos^2\theta_2}=
    \frac{\cos\theta_2-\cos\theta_1}{\cos^2\theta_2}
\end{multline}
